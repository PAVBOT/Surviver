# The Survivor

**The Survivor** is an open-source survival game developed by Pawan Yadav. Your primary objective is to stay safe from hostile enemies and survive until the end. The game is designed to be community-driven, with ongoing development and the potential for user contributions.

## Game Modes

### Open Ground
This mode is currently in early access and under active development. In Open Ground, you can explore a vast environment, though no enemies or weapons are available yet. It's a great mode to familiarize yourself with the game's world.

### TDM (Team Deathmatch)
The Team Deathmatch mode is the main playable mode at the moment, though some bugs are still being addressed. In TDM, you can find and use weapons from supply boxes scattered across the map. The available weapons include:
1. **Sub-Machine Gun**  
   - **Rate of Fire:** 5 shots per second
2. **Rifle**  
   - **Rate of Fire:** 3 shots per second
3. **Glock**  
   - **Rate of Fire:** 1 shot per second

### Deathmatch
In Deathmatch, you'll be able to purchase and equip your favorite weapons using in-game currency (**PAI Coins**). However, this mode is currently unavailable as it is still under development. Your feedback and suggestions are welcomeâ€”please send them to [pavgamestudio@gmail.com](mailto:pavgamestudio@gmail.com).
