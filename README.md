**The Survivor** is a game developed by Pawan Yadav.
In this game, your objective is to stay safe from hostile enemies and survive until the end.

## Game Modes

### Open Ground
This mode is currently under development, but it's open for early access. In this mode, you can explore the environment, although there are currently no enemies r gun to face.
